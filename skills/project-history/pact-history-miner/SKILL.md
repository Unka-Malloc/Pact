# Pact History Miner

## Purpose

Find local AI-agent development conversations that relate to Pact and its legacy project names. Prefer archiving each matched conversation as a reference file; do not distill or rewrite conversation content unless the user explicitly asks for a separate summary.

## Default Project Identity

Treat these as the same project lineage unless current evidence says otherwise:

- Current: `Pact`, `Unka-Malloc/Pact`, `/Users/unka/DevSpace/Unka-Malloc/Pact`
- Legacy: `splitall`, `SplitAll`, `/Users/unka/DevSpace/Unka-Malloc/Pact`
- Legacy product wording: `agent studio`, `Agent Studio`, `agentstudio`, `agent-studio`, `agent_studio`

## Workflow

1. Read `references/local-history-sources.md` if source coverage or storage locations matter.
2. Run `scripts/find_project_history.py --archive-conversations` from the relevant project checkout.
3. Use `conversation-index.md` as the primary inventory. Each archived file is named as `source__session__datetime__hash.md`.
4. Review `summary.md` for source coverage and scan errors, then inspect `matches.jsonl` only when exact matched records are needed.
5. Prefer high-confidence matches that include a project path or legacy name. Treat bare `Pact` matches as weaker unless the surrounding snippet is clearly about this repo.

## Commands

From the Pact checkout:

```bash
python3 /Users/unka/DevSpace/Unka-Malloc/Pact/skills/project-history/pact-history-miner/scripts/find_project_history.py \
  --project-root /Users/unka/DevSpace/Unka-Malloc/Pact \
  --archive-conversations
```

Add extra tool-specific folders:

```bash
python3 /Users/unka/DevSpace/Unka-Malloc/Pact/skills/project-history/pact-history-miner/scripts/find_project_history.py \
  --project-root /Users/unka/DevSpace/Unka-Malloc/Pact \
  --archive-conversations \
  --root /path/to/other/history \
  --root /path/to/exported/transcripts
```

Choose an explicit archive directory:

```bash
python3 /Users/unka/DevSpace/Unka-Malloc/Pact/skills/project-history/pact-history-miner/scripts/find_project_history.py \
  --project-root /Users/unka/DevSpace/Unka-Malloc/Pact \
  --archive-conversations \
  --output-dir /Users/unka/DevSpace/Unka-Malloc/Pact/.pact-agent-history
```

Exclude the current investigation thread when it dominates results:

```bash
python3 /Users/unka/DevSpace/Unka-Malloc/Pact/skills/project-history/pact-history-miner/scripts/find_project_history.py \
  --project-root /Users/unka/DevSpace/Unka-Malloc/Pact \
  --archive-conversations \
  --before 2026-05-22T20:00:00
```

Capture full redacted matching records in `matches.jsonl`:

```bash
python3 /Users/unka/DevSpace/Unka-Malloc/Pact/skills/project-history/pact-history-miner/scripts/find_project_history.py \
  --project-root /Users/unka/DevSpace/Unka-Malloc/Pact \
  --archive-conversations \
  --include-full-text
```

## Output Contract

With `--archive-conversations`, the scanner writes into `<project-root>/.pact-agent-history` by default. Expected files:

- `summary.md`: source inventory, counts, and top snippets.
- `matches.jsonl`: one JSON record per matched transcript line, SQLite row, or text record.
- `sources.json`: discovered roots, skipped roots, and scan errors.
- `conversation-index.md`: human-readable inventory of archived conversation files.
- `conversation-index.jsonl`: machine-readable inventory.
- `conversations/*.md`: one reference file per matched conversation/source session.

Do not paste large raw histories into chat. Cite archived conversation file paths plus record ids so the user can inspect exact records.

## Matching Guidance

Use confidence levels this way:

- `high`: exact project path, legacy name, or several independent project terms.
- `medium`: one strong legacy/current project term with useful surrounding context.
- `low`: bare `Pact` or weak term match; inspect manually before using.

If a known local tool is absent, report it as "not present on this machine" rather than treating it as scanned.

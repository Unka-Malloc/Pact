Thank you for your interest in contributing to **AgentStudio** — a controllable agent collaboration platform (可控的智能体协作空间). We welcome contributions from the community and are grateful for every pull request, bug report, and idea.

> *"In AgentStudio, agents are not trusted. We only trust verifiable asset states and a replayable operation ledger."*

## Reporting Bugs & Requesting Features / 报告 Bug 与功能请求

We use **GitHub Issues** to track bugs, feature requests, and discussions.

### Bug Reports / 报告 Bug

When filing a bug, please include:

1. **Environment** — OS, Node.js version, browser (if applicable), Rust/Flutter versions
2. **Steps to reproduce** — A clear, minimal set of steps
3. **Expected behavior** — What you expected to happen
4. **Actual behavior** — What actually happened
5. **Logs / Screenshots** — Server logs, console output, or screenshots if relevant

👉 [**Open a Bug Report**](https://github.com/Unka-Malloc/AgentStudio/issues/new?labels=bug)

### Feature Requests / 功能请求

For feature requests, describe:

1. **The problem** you're trying to solve
2. **Your proposed solution** (if any)
3. **Alternatives** you've considered
4. **Context** — Which component(s) would be affected (`server`, `server-web`, `client-cli`, `client-gui`, `modules`)

👉 [**Open a Feature Request**](https://github.com/Unka-Malloc/AgentStudio/issues/new?labels=enhancement)

> **Note**: For security vulnerabilities, please **do not** open a public issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead.

## Development Environment Setup / 开发环境搭建

### Prerequisites / 前提条件

- **Node.js** ≥ 18.x
- **npm** ≥ 9.x
- **Rust** toolchain (for `client-cli`)
- **Flutter** SDK (for `client-gui`)

### Getting Started / 快速开始

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Unka-Malloc/AgentStudio.git
cd AgentStudio

# 2. Install server dependencies
npm install

# 3. Install client dependencies (Flutter/Rust assets)
npm run client:get

# 4. Start all services (API server + Web console)
npm run start:all
```

For development with Vite HMR (Hot Module Replacement):

```bash
npm run start:all -- --dev
```

Once running, access the management console in your browser and connect local agents to the MCP Service endpoint.

---

## Code Style / 代码风格

All code should conform to the standards documented in:

📖 **[Developer Guidelines](docs/DEVELOPER-GUIDELINES.md)**

Key principles:

- Follow the existing patterns in each component (`server`, `server-web`, `client-cli`, `client-gui`)
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming conventions
- Include JSDoc / Rustdoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions focused and composable

---

## Git Workflow / Git 工作流

We follow a structured branching model. Please read the full workflow guide:

📖 **[Git Collaboration Guide](docs/GIT-COLLAB.md)**

In summary:

1. **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch from `main`
2. **Name branches** descriptively (e.g., `feat/checkpoint-export`, `fix/ledger-race-condition`)
3. **Rebase** your branch onto the latest `main` before submitting a PR
4. **Squash** trivial commits to keep history clean

---

## Pull Request Process / 拉取请求流程

### Before Submitting / 提交前

- [ ] Ensure your code builds successfully (`npm run start:all`)
- [ ] Run existing tests and ensure they pass
- [ ] Update documentation if your change affects public APIs or user-facing behavior
- [ ] Add/update tests for new functionality
- [ ] Self-review your diff for unintended changes

### PR Expectations / PR 审查要求

1. **Title**: Use [Conventional Commits](#commit-message-format--提交信息格式) format
2. **Description**: Clearly explain *what* changed, *why*, and *how*
3. **Scope**: Keep PRs focused — one logical change per PR
4. **Review turnaround**: Maintainers aim to provide initial review within **5 business days**
5. **Iteration**: Be responsive to review feedback; stale PRs (>30 days inactive) may be closed

### Review Criteria / 审查标准

- Adherence to code style and architectural principles
- Test coverage for new behavior
- No regressions to existing functionality
- Consistency with the zero-trust governance model
- Alignment with the project's [core design documents](#core-design-documents--核心设计文档)

---

## Core Design Documents / 核心设计文档

AgentStudio maintains **5 core design documents** that define the project's architecture and philosophy. These are the canonical sources of truth:

| # | Document | Purpose |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | [Architecture Overview](docs/Architecture.md) | System-level design and component relationships |
| 2 | [Workspace Asset Governance](docs/WORKSPACE-ASSET-GOVERNANCE.md) | Asset lifecycle, Operation Ledger, and policy rules |
| 3 | [Knowledge Governance](docs/KNOWLEDGE-GOVERNANCE.md) | AgentLibrary, knowledge slicing, and access control |
| 4 | [Protocols](docs/PROTOCOLS.md) | MCP integration and inter-component communication |
| 5 | [Server](docs/SERVER.md) | Control Plane internals and API surface |

> ⚠️ **Important Rule / 重要规则**:
>
> **Do not create new lateral design documents.** All architectural decisions and design rationale must be integrated into one of the 5 core documents listed above. If you believe a new document is necessary, propose it in an issue first and reference [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for the documentation governance policy.

---

## Commit Message Format / 提交信息格式

We follow the **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** specification.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes |
| `style` | Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.) |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `build` | Build system or external dependency changes |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration changes |
| `chore` | Other changes that don't modify src or test files |

### Scopes

Use component names as scopes: `server`, `web`, `cli`, `gui`, `modules`, `docs`, `build`

### Examples

```
feat(server): add checkpoint export endpoint for Operation Ledger

fix(web): resolve asset browser pagination overflow

docs(server): update MCP Service configuration reference

refactor(modules): extract knowledge slicing into standalone pipeline
```
